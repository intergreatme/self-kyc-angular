This project is a starting point for building your own Self KYC application with Angular.
A few resources to get you started if this is your first Angular project:
<br>

<a href="https://cli.angular.io/">Angular CLI</a>
> npm install -g @angular/cli <br>
> ng new my-dream-app <br>
> cd my-dream-app <br>
> ng serve <br>

<strong>ng new</strong>
The Angular CLI makes it easy to create an application that already works, right out of the box. It already follows our best practices!

<strong>ng generate</strong>
Generate components, routes, services and pipes with a simple command. The CLI will also create simple test shells for all of these.

<strong>ng serve</strong>
Easily test your app locally while developing.

<strong>Test, Lint</strong>
Make your code really shine. Run your unit tests, your end-to-end tests, or execute the official Angular linter with the breeze of a command.
